#DAIRINJAN: basicPythonImageManipulation
making the image negative and flipping the image

This is my first python programming.

in this file, we have a normal image and then we try to inver the color into a negative.

for example

RGB(255,0,0)

Red = 255    ---> 0
Red = 254    ---> 1

Blue = 100   --->155
